// the pocket is a contract that is to be created conterfactually on the dst chain in the scenario where
// there is a dst swap. the main problem the pocket tries to solve is to gain the ability to know when and
// by how much the bridged tokens are received.
// when chainhop backend builds a cross-chain swap, it calculates a swap id (see _computeSwapId in
// ExecutionNode) and the id is used as the salt in generating a pocket address on the dst chain.
// this address is then assigned as the receiver of the bridge out tokens on the dst chain to temporarily
// hold the funds until the actual pocket contract is deployed at the exact address during the message execution.
